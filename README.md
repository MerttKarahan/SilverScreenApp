Hi! My name is Mert Karahan. I am iOS developer. I developed SilverScreenApp for improve my app development and unit test skills.

You can review popular, trending, upcoming and top-rated movies and TV series on SilverScreenApp. When you go to the details page of the movie or series, you will see the trailer section, detailed information section, similar content section, and comments section. Here you can examine the content you want in detail and add it to your favorites or remove it from favorites. You can search for the TV series or movie you want in the search section of the application and go into their details. In the favorites section, you can review the content you added to your favorites or remove it from your favorites by swiping. In the Profile area, you can review profile details such as account creation date, username and profile photo and log out.
